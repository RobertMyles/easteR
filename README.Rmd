# easteRme

The goal of easteRme is to ... tell you when Easter is! (Or Carnaval and/or Corpus Christi.)

## Example

Yes, now this common dilemma can be solved with the magic of R. No more wandering in desolate ignorance for you, my fRiend! With `easteRme`, you can simply let R do the 'hard' work for you. Why, we can even see when Easter will fall in 2032:  

```{r,  message = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("RobertMyles/easteRme")
library(easteRme)

easteR_me(year = 2032)
```

Phew! Problem solved.
